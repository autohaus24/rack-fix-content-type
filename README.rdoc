= RackFixContentType

Fixes the content type of form uploads by using the file-utility. A lot of browsers screw up the content type so we don't trust the given value in the header.

==Usage

For rails, in environment.rb, just add

  config.middleware.use "RackFixContentType::Middleware"

For sinatra, add

  use RackFixContentType::Middleware

Other rack applications need to use the middleware accordingly.


==License
